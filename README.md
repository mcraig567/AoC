Advent of Code - 2020

This was my first year of Advent of Code after my old roommate pushed it on Twitter the previous years.

All work was done in Python, future years may be done in C.

I accidentally saved over the first half of problems for a number of the first days. These are all commented at the top of the code, and can also be seen
as there is only one file saved for that day.
